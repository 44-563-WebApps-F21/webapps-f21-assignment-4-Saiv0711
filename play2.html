        <h6 class="name LORDAUGUSTUS">LORD AUGUSTUS.</h6>  <p class="Speech">Dear lady, I am in such suspense!  May I not have an
        answer to my request?</p>

        <h6 class="name MRSERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</h6>  <p class="Speech">Lord Augustus, listen to me.  You are to take Lord
        Windermere down to your club at once, and keep him there as long as
        possible.  You understand?</p>

        <h6 class="name LORDAUGUSTUS">LORD AUGUSTUS.</h6>  <p class="Speech">But you said you wished me to keep early hours!</p>

        <h6 class="name MRSERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</h6>  <p class="stage-direction">[_Nervously_.]</p>  <p class="Speech">Do what I tell you.  Do what I tell you.</p>

        <h6 class="name LORDAUGUSTUS">LORD AUGUSTUS.</h6>  <p class="Speech">And my reward?</p>

        <h6 class="name MRSERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</h6>  <p class="Speech">Your reward?  Your reward?  Oh! ask me that to-morrow.
        But don’t let Windermere out of your sight to-night.  If you do I will
        never forgive you.  I will never speak to you again.  I’ll have nothing
        to do with you.  Remember you are to keep Windermere at your club, and
        don’t let him come back to-night.</p>
